# Loan Defaulter Prediction Using Naive Bayes 🚀

### Overview 🌟
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting loan defaulters using the **Naive Bayes** classification algorithm. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of handling real-world datasets, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and insights.

---

### Features 📋
- **Data Analysis**: Gain insights into key patterns in loan data.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning models.
- **Naive Bayes Implementation**: Train and evaluate the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Visualization**: Use data visualizations to understand results and explain model behavior.

---

### Tools and Libraries 🛠️
This project uses:
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating the Naive Bayes model.
